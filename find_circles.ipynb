To crop the calibration panel, I used the bounding box that I predicted with my darknet model.\n","At the end, you can see the circle drawing on the cropped calibration panel. It detects approximately 50% of them. Circles not detected often correspond to blurred image or a calibration panel which is at the extremity of the image. However you can try differents parameters for the HoughCircle function and differents images treatment. I used these parameters because when the circle in the calibration panel is detected, it draws well the circle inside."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"background_save":true},"id":"MPF20cpYY4zF"},"outputs":[],"source":["!ln -s /content/gdrive/MyDrive/ /mydrive2"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"OLOqfjvsVC6z"},"outputs":[],"source":["from google.colab.patches import cv2_imshow\n","import numpy as np\n","import json\n","import cv2"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"background_save":true},"id":"USJF7eAPc8Q3"},"outputs":[],"source":["def load_predictions(file_path):\n","    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:\n","        predictions = json.load(file)\n","    return predictions"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"background_save":true},"id":"F28mzpsFc-G0"},"outputs":[],"source":["def calculate_conversion_factor(objects, calibration_square_cm2, image_width, image_height):\n","    for obj in objects:\n","        label = obj[\"name\"]\n","        confidence = obj[\"confidence\"]\n","        bbox = list(obj[\"relative_coordinates\"].values())\n","        if label == \"calibrage\":\n","            #
